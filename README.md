# Night_Canteen

This project was made by me and my team for the Hostel's Night Canteen Management at my college. The project is an Android application with two interfaces: a student interface and a staff interface.

Student Interface: The University will provide the student with a Wi-Fi password and registration number for access. The student can add items to the basket after providing the right password, but in order to successfully place an order, the student must make the final payment. Any online payment app that supports UPI can be used to make a payment; upon successful payment, an order will be placed and the items will be removed from the database.

Staff Interface: After entering their employee ID and password to access the app, staff members will be able to update the menu items, prices, and quantities available. The database will be immediately updated with these changes.
